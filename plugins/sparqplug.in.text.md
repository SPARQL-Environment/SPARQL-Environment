## Text Query

Standard SPARQL query environment.

**Autocompletion**

- Autocomplete prefixes.
- Define objects and quickly search for an object from a collection of objects.
Example: In Botony one can define "species" as "urn:cite:botcar:species cite:possesses ?specie" and you could search those objects for a quick lookup.
